Permalink Manager lets you customize the complete URL addresses of your posts, pages, custom post types, terms, and WooCommerce links with ease without touching any core files.

== Description ==

Permalink Manager is a highly rated WordPress permalink editor that allows users to customize post, page, and custom post type URLs (taxonomies are supported in Pro version).

If you want your website to be optimized for search engines, you must give careful consideration to the structure of your URLs. When you use Permalink Manager, it is a piece of cake as **you have complete control over your WordPress permalinks!**

The plugin works with all custom post types and taxonomies, as well as many popular third-party plugins like as WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, WPML, and Polylang. To improve user experience and eliminate 404 or duplicated content errors, the original permalinks will automatically redirect your visitors to the new customized URL. What is more, using the plugin options you can modify the redirect and trailing slashes functions, which further improves SEO performance.

* **Edit the individual permalinks as you choose**<br/>For a consistent and SEO-friendly URL structure, you may customize and <a href="https://permalinkmanager.pro/docs/basics/change-permalinks/">change the permalink</a> of each post, page, and custom post type item.  *Categories, tags & custom taxonomies terms permalinks can be edited in Permalink Manager Pro.*
* **Edit URLs in bulk using permalink formats**<br/>In order to speed up the process of bulk URL modification, the plugin allows you to choose the default format for custom URLs using "Permastructures" settings. The new format will be applied automatically when a new post/term is added or once the old permalinks are regenerated.
* **Custom post types support**<br/>You may easily remove post type rewrite (base) slugs from your WordPress permalinks, for example. The plugin may be configured to filter just specified post types and taxonomies permalinks, excluding the rest of your content types.
* **Translate permalinks**<br/>If you have the WPML or Polylang plugins installed on your website, Permalink Manager allows you to translate the slug and specify different permalink format/structure for each language.
* **Remove parent slugs**<br/>Looking for a simple solution to shorten lengthy, hierarchical URL addresses? The plugin may be used to <a href="https://permalinkmanager.pro/docs/basics/bulk-edit-custom-permalinks/#remove-parent-slugs/">remove parent slugs from WordPress permalinks</a>.
* **Add category slug to post permalinks**<br/>Do you want to <a href="https://permalinkmanager.pro/docs/tutorials/add-category-slug-wordpress-permalinks/">add category slugs in your post permalinks</a>? Permalink Manager is the most convenient way to create a silo structure for your URL addresses.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin to edit the category permalinks?
This feature is available only in Permalink Manager Pro.

= Is it possible to use Permalink Manager on large websites?
When the Permalink Manager was first designed, it was supposed to be used for a typical WordPress website, which usually has <strong>less than a few thousand subpages</strong>. As a result, all custom permalinks are <a href="https://permalinkmanager.pro/docs/filters-hooks/how-the-custom-uris-and-redirects-are-stored/">saved in a single row in the database</a> in order to avoid slowing down the pageload with multiple SQL queries to the database. This is the most effective approach for small and medium-sized websites, without affecting site speed.

While this data structure works for the vast majority of WordPress sites, it may not be optimal if you want to use the plugin to rewrite <strong>tens of thousands of permalinks</strong>. What works well for a smaller website may not scale well for a megasite. When the number of addresses on your site exceeds tens of thousands, the custom permalinks array may become quite huge, and any operations on it can have an effect on pageload time.

To summarize, the plugin is suitable for small and medium-sized websites. It will not slow down your pageload time or affect its usability in any way. However, if you want to use it on a much bigger website with thousands of permalinks (more than 60.000), please consider excluding content types that do not require customized permalink format in order to lower the custom permalinks array. For further details on the plugin's performance, please <a href="https://permalinkmanager.pro/docs/basics/performance/">visit this post</a>.

= Can I define different permalink formats per each language.
Yes, it is possible if you are using either WPML or Polylang. You can find <a href="https://permalinkmanager.pro/docs/tutorials/how-to-translate-permalinks/">the full instructions here</a>.

= Will the old permalink automatically redirect the new ones?
Yes, Permalink Manager will automatically redirect the native permalinks (used when the plugin is disabled, or before it was activated) to the actual, custom permalinks.

= Does this plugin support Buddypress?
Currently, there is no 100% guarantee that Permalink Manager will work correctly with Buddypress.

= Can I remove the plugin after the permalinks are updated? =
Yes, if you used Permalink Manager only to regenerate the slugs (native post names). Please note that if you use custom permalinks (that differ from the native ones), they will no longer be used after the plugin is disabled.

It is because Permalink Manager overwrites one of the core WordPress functionalities to bypass the rewrite rules ("regular expressions" to detect the posts/pages/taxonomies/etc. and another parameters from the URL) by using the array of custom permalinks (you can check them in "Debug" tab) that are used only by the plugin.
