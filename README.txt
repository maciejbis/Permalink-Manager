Advanced plugin that allows to set-up custom permalinks (bulk editors included), slugs and permastructures (WooCommerce compatible).

== Description ==

Permalink Manager is a most advanced and highly rated Wordpress permalink plugin that helps Wordpress users to control the URL addresses of all posts, pages, custom post type elements (taxonomies are supported in Pro version). To avoid 404 or duplicated content errors after the new custom permalink is defined, the visitors trying to access the old permalink will be automatically redirected to the new custom URL.

The plugin supports all custom post types & custom taxonomies and popular 3rd party plugins including WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, WPML, and Polylang. To improve SEO performance even more, the plugin settings provide a possibility to disable the canonical redirect (used natively by Wordpress) and control the trailing slashes settings.

= All features =

* **Edit full permalinks** | A completely custom permalink can be set for each post, page and public custom post type individually *(categories, tags & custom taxonomies terms permalinks can be edited in Permalink Manager Pro)*
* **Custom post types support** | It is also possible to exclude specific post types & taxonomies to stop Permalink Manager from filtering their permalinks.
* **Custom permastructures** | The plugin allows to specify how the custom permalinks should be formatted by default (when the new post/term is added or after the permalinks are regenerated)
* **Bulk editors** | "Regenerate/Reset" + "Find and replace" tools that allow to bulk/mass change the permalinks (or native slugs).
* **Auto-redirect** | Old (native) permalinks are redirected to new (custom) permalinks (in 301 or 302 mode) to prevent 404 error (SEO friendly).
* **Canonical redirects** | Possibility to disable native canonical redirects.
* **Trailing slashes settings** | They can be forced or removed from all permalinks.

= Additional features available in Permalink Manager Pro =

* **Taxonomies** | Full support for taxonomies (categories, tags & custom taxonomies).
* **WooCommerce** | Full support for WooCommerce (products, product tags, product categories). Permalink Manager allows to remove /product-category and /product from WooCommerce permalinks.
* **WooCommerce coupon URLs** | Coupon codes may have their public URLs (eg. http://shop.com/BLACKFRIDAY) that will automatically apply the discount to the cart.
* **Custom fields** | Custom fields can be used inside permalinks (Advanced Custom Fields plugin supported).
* **Extra internal redirects** | Multiple URLs can lead to a single post/term (they could be defined individually for each element).
* **External URL redirect** | Posts/terms can redirect the visitors to external websites (the URLs could be defined individually for each element).
* **"Stop-words"** | User-defined words will be automatically removed from default permalinks.
* **Custom Permalinks** | Import custom permalinks saved with that plugin.
* **Priority support** | All the support requests from Permalink Manager Pro users are handled in the first place.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Can I delete/disable Permalink Manager after the permalinks are updated? =
A. Yes, if you used Permalink Manager only to regenerate the slugs (native post names). Please note that if you use custom permalinks (that differ from the native ones), they will no longer be used after the plugin is disabled.

It is because Permalink Manager overwrites one of the core Wordpress functionalities to bypass the rewrite rules ("regular expressions" to detect the posts/pages/taxonomies/etc. and another parameters from the URL) by using the array of custom permalinks (you can check them in "Debug" tab) that are used only by my plugin.

= Q. Can I use Permalink Manager to change the terms permalinks (eg. post or product categories)?
A. This feature is available only in Permalink Manager Pro.

= Q. Does this plugin support Buddypress?
A. Currently there is no 100% guarantee that Permalink Manager will work correctly with Buddypress.
